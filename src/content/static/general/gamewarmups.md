## Stretching warm-ups

Prior to any physical activity, the players should stretch and be physically ready. Please review [our practice warm-ups](/blog/warmups) if there are any questions.

## The field

| Time | Activity | Coach | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00:00 - 00:05 | Mobility prep warm-up | Coach Flay or Team Captain led | outfield near bench |
| 00:05 - 00:20 | Throwing progressions | Team Captain led | 1st or 3rd base line |
| 00:20 - 00:50 | Pitchers and catchers warm-ups | player led | outfield near bench |
|  | Batting stations†† | player led | outfield near bench |
|  | Fly and ground balls | coach assisted | outfield near bench |
|  | Infield drills | coach assisted | infield |


<small>†† The batting stations will be along the baseline closest to the team's dugout. Suggested drills are to swing at the tee and soft-toss. A set of two players should be at each batting station, one assisting the other. Please do not spend more than 10min at each of the batting stations.</small>

Prior to game start, coaches will gather the players to the infield for shortstop to first and pop-fly drills. We ask that the players pay close attention and move quickly through the warm-up drills as we want to get in as many reps as possible and we have limited time to do so.
