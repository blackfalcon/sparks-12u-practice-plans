# Pre-game warm-up routine

Pre-game warm-ups are an essential part of playing a game. This gives the player time to get into a game mindset and prepare for the challenges ahead. We ask that the players keep a serious mindset while warming up, but also have fun and be playful. We ask that the `players arrive at least one hour prior to game start` for team meetings and the warm-up routine.

Due to limited time and the rolling in of players, we are suggesting a `get a buddy` system. What this means is, as players get the the field, please grab a buddy and begin the full warm up routine.

## Stretching warm-ups

Prior to any physical activity, the players should stretch and be physically ready. Prior to game play, players will cycle in and waiting for all the players to arrive to pre-game stretch together may not be optional. It is recommended that players grab the few that are available and go through the routine typically used in practice prep.

## The field

The expectations for every pre-game warm-ups are as follows;

1. Get a buddy!
1. Stretch
1. [Throwing progressions](/throwingprogression)
1. Pitchers and catchers should be in a bullpen preparing for the game
1. Batting stations††
1. Fly and ground balls w/coaches

<small>†† The batting stations will be along the baseline closest to the team's dugout. Suggested drills are to swing at the tee and soft-toss. A set of two players should be at each batting station, one assisting the other. Please do not spend more than 10min at each of the batting stations.</small>

Prior to game start, coaches will gather the players to the infield for shortstop to first and pop-fly drills. We ask that the players pay close attention and move quickly through the warm-up drills as we want to get in as many reps as possible and we have limited time to do so.
