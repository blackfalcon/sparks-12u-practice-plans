| 01:40 - 02:00 | Batting | Live pitching / machine | FF |

†† Throwing/shoulder warms ups are to be done at a relaxed pace. Girls should not be throwing hard or exerting themselves. DO NOT throw open-chested towards other player. Players should be facing each other side to side.

As players move further apart, the step-stride (little hop) should be done with the throw. Watch the footwork.

\* This time slot will fluctuate between base running and defensive drills based on the needs of the practice.
