†† Throwing/shoulder warms ups are to be done at a relaxed pace. Girls should not be throwing hard or exerting themselves. DO NOT throw open-chested towards other player. Players should be facing each other side to side.

As players move further apart, the step-stride (a little hop) should be done with the throw.
