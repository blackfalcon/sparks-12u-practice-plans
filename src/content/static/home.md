## Stods Sparks Practice Plans

<auro-alert type="information" style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
It is important that all players arrive at least <code>10min</code> prior to schedule time start. Practice will start precisely <code>00:00</code> of scheduled time.
</auro-alert>

Weekly practices cover a lot, but these practice days alone will not make you a pro. Please use the links provided here to come up with a home practice routine. Pitchers and [catchers](/catchingdrills) are highly encouraged to have a separate additional routine as well. If we are not practicing, at least 30 min at-home work is great! Please don't forget to stretch.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00:00 - 00:05 | Intro | Practice intro, rules and today’s expectations   | DO |
| 00:05 - 00:15 | Warm-ups | Stretch and physical warm-ups (warm-up list) | HP |
| 00:15 - 00:30 |  | Throwing/shoulder warm-ups †† | 1B L |
| 00:35 - 00:45 | Classroom | Today’s classroom | DO |
| 00:45 - 01:00* | Base running | Base running skills station | 1B |
| 00:45 - 01:00* | Defense | Situational defense play | FF |
| 01:00 - 01:10 | Break | | DO |
| 01:10 - 01:40 | Infield | Infield drill station  | SS |
| | Outfield | Outfield drill station | CF |
| | Batting | Batting station (skills balls or off tee) | OF |
| 01:40 - 02:00 | Batting | Live pitching / machine | FF |

†† Throwing/shoulder warms ups are to be done at a relaxed pace. Girls should not be throwing hard or exerting themselves. DO NOT throw open-chested towards other player. Players should be facing each other side to side.

As players move further apart, the step-stride (little hop) should be done with the throw. Watch the footwork.

\* This time slot will fluctuate between base running and defensive drills based on the needs of the practice. -->
