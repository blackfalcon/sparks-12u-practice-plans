#### Warm-ups

Players are to lead their own [warm-up drills](/blog/warmups).

#### Station drills

The following station drills will be run sequentially, not asynchronously. Approx `15min` each series.

| Drill|Description |
|---|---|
|3 cone drill|For the 3 cone drill, a player will be in the SS position. A coach will hit a ball towards them. Player will move through the 3 cones, field the ground ball (two hands), funnel into midsection, shuffle feet to make good strong throw to 1st. 1st will throw back to coach. Once the play is completed, SS will rotate to 1st and 1st will rotate back to 2nd.|
|Receiving throw downs|For this drill, a player will be on 2B and will pretend that a runner is stealing 2nd. Once the runner is out, 2B will throw to 1st and then back to coach. A coach will throw down to 2B playing the role of the catcher. |
|Outfield catch progressions|Split into two groups. Coaches will throw the balls to the players. Players will progress through the following drills; catching over the shoulder, standing catch, and putting it all together. Drop step drill will not be addressed at this time. |

#### Situation drills

Here we will use all the things we learned today in the drills. A coach will hit balls to SS to get the out on 1B. A phantom runner will be stealing 2nd. Coach will also hit pop-fly balls to the outfield, players will be expected to throw the ball into play to tag the phantom runner that is being called out.
