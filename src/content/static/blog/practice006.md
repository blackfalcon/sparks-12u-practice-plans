| Drill|Description |
|---|---|
|Infield|All infield drills will be coached in a single block. Once we get into stealing bases we will need players to rotate through P, 1B and 2B to simulate play. Coaches will place emphasis on proper defense of 1B and 2B. A coach or player may simulate the C for a throw down. |
|Outfield|Progression drills will be supported by multiple coaches to move two groups of players through the progressions. 3 stations. 8-ball, knee to standing catch, and running catch.|
