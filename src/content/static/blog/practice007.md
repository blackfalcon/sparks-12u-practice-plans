|---|---|
|The rules of stealing|In 7.08 (a) (5) Note 2 of Little League Softballâ€™s current Rules, Regulations, and Policies, when the pitcher is in possession of the ball in the circle and is not making a play (for purpose of the rule, feinting a throw is considered a play), all runners off their bases must immediately attempt to advance or retreat. Immediately, is interpreted to mean within a three-second time frame. It is equally important, from an umpire standpoint, to realize that a runner(s) may vacate their bases and begin to attempt to advance once, on EACH play or pitch.<br><br>[The Circle Rule](https://www.littleleague.org/university/articles/softball-base-running-the-circle-rule/)|
|Stealing 2nd on 4th BB|When coach calls "scrambler" the runner is to RUN to 1st on the 4th BB, hesitate and then steal 2nd|
|The delay steal|Review the 'rules of stealing' and practice that moment when the pitcher is not paying attention|
|The fake bunt steal play|Practice a fake bunt to allow a base steal|

#### Fielder priority

- The pitcher has priority over the catcher.
- All infielders have priority over the pitcher and catcher.
- The second baseman has priority over the first baseman.
- The third baseman has priority over the first baseman.
- The shortstop has priority over all the infielders.
- All outfielders have priority over all the infielders.
- The center fielder has priority over the left and right fielders.

If the player feels that he should catch the ball, she should call it after the ball reaches
its highest point and is just beginning to come down.
