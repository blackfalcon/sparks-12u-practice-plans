### Infield

In today’s drill station, we want to emphasize the correct way to field (2-hands) and throw a ball. This will take time and there will be few reps. Emphasize accuracy and form. Coaches should watch this [YouTube video](/properthrowing) prior to drill.

No need for coach to bat, but toss the ball to the player so that she can effectively field the ball correctly and work on throw style. After the throw, the throwing player should run to 1st and be ready to catch the next ball. The player on 1st should throw (correctly and accurately) the ball to home (shagger) and then run to SS on the outside of the play.

### Outfield

The drill needs to work on the basic skill of moving with the ball to catch. A coach can use a squishy ball to toss on the air and the player is to ‘catch’ it with their forehead. Once all players have mastered this basic skill, coach can work up to high toss-up balls to catch.

### Batting

Players can bat into net off tee, soft toss or be tossed skills balls. Reps reps reps. Please review the [proper hitting](/properhitting) mechanics page for instruction.
