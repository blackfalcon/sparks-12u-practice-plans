### Batting/fielding

With help from Coach Richard and the pitching machine + live pitching, let's play a game. Coach Dale and Coach Victor will observe the play and help explain situations as they happen.

Runners, let's be aggressive on the steals. Fielders, let's concentrate on the current play and back each other up to maintain control of the play.

To play, we will put 8/9 players on the field and the remaining players will be hitters. Batters will play until 3 outs and then rotate with players in the field.
