<!-- ### Defense

After demonstrating the [sweep and tag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJUhGMrxdcs&ab_channel=SKLZBaseball) drill, players will line up at 2B to perform the task. A coach or dad will call out __TAG__ or __FORCE__ and throw the ball to 2B.

If the call is __FORCE__, the player is expected to catch the ball with a foot touching the base. There is no need to tag the runner.

If the call is __TAG__, the player is expected to straddle 2B and perform the sweep and tag drill.

### Infield

Line up 2 or 3 player at both the SS and the 1B position. Perform the drills a few times and rotate.

This drill station will be performing the 3 cone drill. A coach will bat or toss a ball to the SS position where the cones are and the players are expected to perform the footwork as described in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaXiNUOzJ2k&ab_channel=ZONEDSportsAcademy). Once the player has the ball, the player is to throw the ball to 1B.

The player on 1B is directed to use the proper footwork as described [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_pHQeIWgsM&ab_channel=ZONEDSportsAcademy).

### Outfield

Players are to work with a dad or coach to perform the [8 ball drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XSifegbj7Y&ab_channel=ChampionshipProductions).

### Batting

Players can bat into net off tee, soft toss or be tossed skills balls. Reps reps reps. Please review the [proper hitting](/properhitting) mechanics page for instruction. -->
