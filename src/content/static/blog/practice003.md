### Intro

Let's talk about practice and pre-game warm up expectations.

__Pre-game warm ups__

Due to limited time and the rolling in of players, we are suggesting a `get a buddy` system. What this means is, as players get the the field, please grab a buddy and begin the full warm up routine.

* Stretch
* Throwing progressions
* Batting station on tee
* Fly and ground balls w/coaches

Pitchers and catchers should be warming up together.

### Classroom

Let's review the last game, what we did great and where we need to improve. During this time the players will be asked to fill out sticky-notes and list out things that they thought went well and things that we could improve on from the last game.

The goal of this exercise is to allow the players to communicate to the coaches what they saw, not what the coaches saw.

### Batting/fielding

Post-classroom we want the players to take the full field. With help from Coach Richard and the pitching machine + live pitching, let's play a game. Coach Dale and Coach Victor will observe the play and help explain situations as they happen.

To play, we will put 8/9 players on the field and the remaining players will be hitters. Once a player hits, at the end of their play they will swap out a player in the field. We will want to play as if this is a real game!

<!-- ### Defense

After demonstrating the [sweep and tag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJUhGMrxdcs&ab_channel=SKLZBaseball) drill, players will line up at 2B to perform the task. A coach or dad will call out __TAG__ or __FORCE__ and throw the ball to 2B.

If the call is __FORCE__, the player is expected to catch the ball with a foot touching the base. There is no need to tag the runner.

If the call is __TAG__, the player is expected to straddle 2B and perform the sweep and tag drill.

### Infield

Line up 2 or 3 player at both the SS and the 1B position. Perform the drills a few times and rotate.

This drill station will be performing the 3 cone drill. A coach will bat or toss a ball to the SS position where the cones are and the players are expected to perform the footwork as described in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaXiNUOzJ2k&ab_channel=ZONEDSportsAcademy). Once the player has the ball, the player is to throw the ball to 1B.

The player on 1B is directed to use the proper footwork as described [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_pHQeIWgsM&ab_channel=ZONEDSportsAcademy).

### Outfield

Players are to work with a dad or coach to perform the [8 ball drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XSifegbj7Y&ab_channel=ChampionshipProductions).

### Batting

Players can bat into net off tee, soft toss or be tossed skills balls. Reps reps reps. Please review the [proper hitting](/properhitting) mechanics page for instruction. -->
